        <hr>
        <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. Explore the exciting developments and impacts of AI.</p>
        <img class="shadow round centered-img" src="images/machine-learning.jpg" alt="AI">
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>
    
        <h2>Types of AI</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/narrow-ai">Narrow AI:</a></strong> Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates under a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. A common example of Narrow AI is a recommendation engine like those used by Netflix or Amazon.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">General AI:</a></strong> This is a type of machine intelligence that is equivalent to human intelligence. General AI can understand, learn, adapt, and implement knowledge in a way similar to a human.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence">Superintelligent AI:</a></strong> This refers to a type of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence and ability. Superintelligent AI is purely theoretical at the moment with no practical examples in use.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI can be used to analyze complex medical data to offer potential treatment pathways.</li>
            <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> AI is at the core of self-driving and autonomous vehicles.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> AI can be used for various financial tasks, like fraud detection, portfolio management, and algorithmic trading.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> AI can help in automating grading, offering students help, and personalizing learning.</li>
        </ul>
